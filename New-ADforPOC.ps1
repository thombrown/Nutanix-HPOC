#Setup Acrive Directory on a freshly installed Windows 2012 R2 VM and
#add a set of AD Groups / Users for use with SSP and/or CALM
#
# This may look complicated but it's simple and requires little input from you - just run it 3 times or twice if you don't want the groups and users!
#
#You need:
#1. ***** A Nutaix Hosted PoC Cluster ===== This script assumes a lot about the datacenter - aimed at easily deploying AD for a POC
#2. A deployed W2K12R2 VM (you can now request deployed VMs via your (AHV) rx reservation booking page)
#3. This script copied to 2. above - copy it to c:\ - there will be 2 re-boots so it's easier to have it there, also it won't matter
#   if you're domain logged or local. Use RDP to copy the file to c:\ but run it from a Prism console - it's easier!
# To copy this straight from Github run the following command - '(Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thombrown/Nutanix/master/New-ADforPOC.ps1).content | Out-File C:\New-ADforPOC.ps1' 
#3.1 On the VM to have AD deployed: You will need to 'Set-Executionpolicy RemoteSigned' (respond with Y) from a powershell window - STARTED IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE, to do this
#    right click on the 'Powershell' icon in the task bar and select 'Run as Administrator' (just the first time to set RemoteSigned and run this script the first time
#    You will run the script THREE times first two times as loca\Administrator and the last time as AD\Administrator - it remembers where it got to each time:
#    - 1st Run (verify POC number, static IP): Changes to a static IP, VM hostname to AD1 (reboots)
#    - 2nd Run (no input from you): Add AD Role and Management Tools, Configures Forest (reboots)
#    - 3rd Run (no input from you): Adds 3 security groups and two users to each group (no reboot)
#4. IP address scheme for your Hosted PoC - I have assumed the standard based on the name of the POC
#   - The last used address in a typical PoC is .37
#   - Will use .40 for the static IP address of the new AD server - you can change it though
#If you don't like any of the parameters go ahead and change them, break at your own risk!
# After running the script 3 times you will end up (assumig defaults):
# 1. A Windows 2012 R2 VM with hostname: AD1 and static IP address of a.b.c.40 (or whatever you chose)
# 2. An AD/DNS called POCnnn.local, eg. if you have POC086 then your AD/DNS would be POC086.local
# 3. AD Group: ntnx-admins with users uadmin1, uadmin2
# 4. AD Group: ntnx-projadmins with users uproj1, uproj2
# 5. AD Group: ntnx-devops with users udevops1, udevops2
# ALL PASSWORDS are nutanix/4u (all AD users, AD Administrator, SafeModeAdministrationPassword for AD) - change if you want.
